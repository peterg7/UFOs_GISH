# UFOs

## Overview
Given a JavaScript file containing UFO sighting information, the task is to display the data as a table and also provide the ability to filter sightings based on select criteria. 

## Resources
Software:
- Anaconda 4.7.12

## Summary
Built a table using to be displayed as a webpage from the data stored in the JavaScript array. Added a filter by date feature to make the page dynamic and it will react to user input. Then using Bootcamp templates, the entire page was presented in an astecially-pleasing way.

## Challenge Overview
With the date filter in place, it would be more useful to have multiple conditions to filter for. These new categories are city, state, country, and shape. Having the ability to filter more selectively will help provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

## Challenge Summary
By adding on to the initial script for the webpage, four more filters for the table containing the data were created. Bootstrap was used to customize the page and because of the grid system Bootstrap uses, allows for a responsive webpage that is easily organized. An added feature for the future could be the ability to search comments for certain terms. It would be useful to be able to search for sightings that reported a "red" color.
